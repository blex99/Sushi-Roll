# Sushi-Roll
A food-themed, 2D marble game, where you control the platforms rather than the player.  

Q: Who made this?  
A: Ludum Fabri for the Game Development Process class at Sierra College. Team members include: Mike Bodily, Alex Chapman (me), Willis Peterson, and Elin Saldivar.  

Q: When was this game made?  
A: Spring 2018  
  
Q: What challenges came about when creating this?  
A: This was the first game I had ever made. I had very little programming experience, and had never used Game Maker 2 or GameMakerLanguage (GML) before.  
  
Q: What things inspired/ helped you to make this?  
A: Super Monkey Ball is how the game's concept came about. Shaun Spalding, a youtuber who makes GameMaker/ game development tutorials is 'the' reason I was able to create this game. I cannot thank him enough.
